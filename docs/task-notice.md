### Things to keep in mind when creating your tasks- and information you can not ask for in tasks- this is very important.

* Only Org Admins can publish tasks so you are ultimately responsible for what tasks are available for students. Mentors can create tasks but you (Org Admins) have to publish them (you can do bulk publishing, so don't worry).

* Do not create any tasks that require students to supply personal information. For example, what country they live in, pictures of the student, hobbies, etc. This is personal information and can not be asked or required of students in any manner. If you are unsure about a task please reach out to gci-support@google.com and we can okay it or say it's not acceptable.

* Tasks should have a specific tangible output. Code, graphics, documentation, tests, test verification, etc.

* It is not a "task" to require someone to make an account, sign up for a mailing list, or follow you on social media. Some of those things are overhead, some of the others are blatant marketing and don't benefit the student. We understand that sometimes this kind of trivial task is used as a beginner / hook task, but you'll need to find other things that are not trivial and don't violate privacy concerns.

* No tasks asking students to write blog posts about themselves. You can ask students to write a blog post about some kind of research related to your org, etc. but not a task asking them to write about their favorite tasks or why they are participating, etc.
